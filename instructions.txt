OH NO!!!!
I am so frustrated right now. I was in the middle of refactoring my
game code to make it a bit cleaner and a bit easier to read, and 
somehow I have managed to earase MOST of my game loop!  Yes, I tried
the undo command.  It didn't work.

I can't be bothered to fix it at this point. So I am tasking you with
finishing the game.

1) Go through the game loop and fix all of the missing update loops.
2) Go through the game loop and fix all of the missing draw loops.
3) Add music to the game.  
4) Add a sound effect to the game when the player fires a bullet.
5) The font is fine.... but I bet it would be a lot cooler if you 
added in a new external font.
6) Currently the game is fine... but I think it would be really cool
if after you shot an asteroid, it broke apart into 2 smaller asteroids
that travels slightly different directions.
7)Those smaller asteroids should only be worth 5 points.  Adjust the way
scoring is done to accompdate this.  There are several ways to make this 
happen.
